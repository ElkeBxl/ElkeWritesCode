# ElkeWritesCode

Curriculum Vitae site for Elke Heymans.

## The story behind this

I've always wanted to tackle the challenge of designing and implementing my own responsive website in HTML5 & CSS3 with the help of Bootstrap3 and as little as possible JavaScript/jQuery. I've built everything from scratch which isn't easy but I like the challenge.

## The future of this

I will continue to update this CV site as much as possible. My goal is to utilise more relevant technologies. What started out as a site only built in HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript/jQuery, could grow into a site where I also introduce LESS and maybe some Angular in the future. It could be an interesting playground to test out on a small basis some new stuff.

## Changelog

### Version 3.0 (Future release)

Introducing support for xs and sm views as well as testing on other devices and browsers.

### Version 2.0 (Next release)

Optimisation of the HTML & CSS code by introducing concepts as LESS and cleaning up all the code.

### Version 1.0 (Current release): live on ? sep 2017

Earliest version was only in HTML5, CSS3 & some small JavaScript. It contained the most basic styling and basic text and could be regarded as a setup phase. There was only support for >md views and was only tested in Chrome.
