				<h3>My name is Elke, I'm a <em>webdeveloper</em> and <em>photographer</em></h3>
				<p>IT has always been one of my biggest interests. At a young age, I already was pretty curious on how to develop websites, both front-end and back-end. The obvious choice for me was to pursue a career in IT. As a side job, I also do photography in which I can let my creativity bloom. In my spare time I like to work on personal photography projects, catch some good concerts and hang out with friends.</p>

					I returned to my first team to continue development on internal .Net web/batch applications. I also started working at newer projects that use ASP.Net MVC and AngularJS. With the newer projects came new responsibilities such as doing analysis, reporting to clients and leading daily standup meetings. Currently I enjoy doing multiple aspects of a project: helping with defining requirements, developing applications and helping with deployment and maintenance.

				<article class="col-md-8">
					<p>What started out as a hobby, grew eventually into a passion. In February 2017, I made the jump to become a photographer in my spare time. This allowed me to express my creativity even more and to pay back all the expenses that I made for my photography. I've developed my own <a href="http://elke.photos">portfolio</a> in HTML5 &amp; CSS3 with the help of AngularJS to show my latest assignments. The reason why I've developed it myself, was to have all the freedom I needed. I'm currently in the process of redesigning my portfolio and rebuilding it with a proper .Net Core backend and an AngularJS frontend. In future releases, a migration to Angular2 might be interesting to test my skills.</p>

					<p>Also known as this site. I've always wanted to tackle the challenge of designing and implementing my own responsive website in HTML5 &amp; CSS3 with the help of Bootstrap3 and as little as possible JavaScript. I've built everything from scratch and you can check out the source code on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ElkeBxl/ElkeWritesCode">project</a> page.</p>
